<p>The secret to building large apps is never build large apps. Break your applications into small pieces. Then, assemble those testable, bite-sized pieces into your big application.</p>

<p>The key is to acknowledge from the start that you have no idea how this will grow. When you accept that you don't know everything, you begin to design the system defensively... You should spend most of your time thinking about interfaces rather than implementations.</p>

<p>In 1984, Bob Scheifler and Jim Gettys set out the early principles of X:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not add new functionality unless an implementor cannot complete a real application without it.</li>
<li>It is as important to decide what a system is not as to decide what it is. Do not serve all the world's needs; rather, make the system extensible so that additional needs can be met in an upwardly compatible fashion.</li>
<li>The only thing worse than generalizing from one example is generalizing from no examples at all.</li>
<li>If a problem is not completely understood, it is probably best to provide no solution at all.</li>
<li>If you can get 90 percent of the desired effect for 10 percent of the work, use the simpler solution. (See also Worse is better.)</li>
<li>Isolate complexity as much as possible.</li>
<li>Provide mechanism rather than policy. In particular, place user interface policy in the clients' hands.</li>
</ul><p>The first principle was modified during the design of X11 to: "Do not add new functionality unless you know of some real application that will require it."</p>

<p>Don’t write code (write new code only when everything else fails) is the single most important lesson every developer needs to learn. The amount of duplicate, crappy code (across projects) that exists today is overwhelming. In a lot of cases developers don’t even bother to look around. They just want to write code.</p>

Any time you see these signs, you probably should have just written a function.</p>

<a name="write-unit-tests" class="anchor" href="#write-unit-tests"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Write unit tests.</h2>

<p>Every programmer knows they should write tests for
their code. Few do. The universal response to "Why not?" is "I'm
in too much of a hurry." This quickly becomes a vicious cycle- the more pressure you feel, the fewer tests you write. The fewer tests you write, the less productive you are and the less stable your code becomes. The less productive and accurate you are, the more pressure you feel.
Programmers burn out from just such cycles.
Breaking out requires an outside influence. We found the outside influence we needed in a simple testing framework that lets us do a little testing that
makes a big difference.</p>

<p>"Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered.

<p>Software can only partially be designed in advance. ... requirements suffer from observation, that the act of building software causes the requirements to change. ...technical factors cannot be perfectly understood, that only the act of trying to build something with specific components will reveal all of the gotchas and who-knews associated with a chosen technology strategy. ...software design is an iterative process, starting with a best guess that is continually refined with experience.
the normal case for software projects is that tasks are rarely completed exactly as estimated, but that as a project progresses, the aggregate variance from estimates falls.</p>

<p>Nobody likes to look stupid. If you’re a professional and someone puts you on the spot to answer “how long will this take?” it’s only human to want to provide an answer. Whether you call it professional pride or ego, it’s a powerful driver.
Good IT workers really don’t like saying “I don’t know.” If they say it, they probably mean it. So stop pushing for a definitive answer when one doesn’t exist.It’s perfectly reasonable to want some sort of plan up front. I’m actually one of those funny types who believe up front planning is a necessity. So long as everyone understands an estimate is just that: an estimate. You learn as you go along and discover more detail. So you revise the estimate accordingly.</p>

<p>"This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface" - Doug McIlroy, quoted in A Quarter Century of Unix [Salus]. Addison-Wesley. 1994. ISBN 0-201-54777-5.</p>

<ul>
<li>Rule of Modularity: Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces.</li>
<li>Rule of Clarity: Clarity is better than cleverness.</li>
<li>Rule of Composition: Design programs to be connected to other programs.</li>
<li>Rule of Separation: Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines.</li>
<li>Rule of Simplicity: Design for simplicity; add complexity only where you must.</li>
<li>Rule of Parsimony: Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do.</li>
<li>Rule of Transparency: Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier.</li>
<li>Rule of Robustness: Robustness is the child of transparency and simplicity.</li>
<li>Rule of Representation: Fold knowledge into data so program logic can be stupid and robust.</li>
<li>Rule of Least Surprise: In interface design, always do the least surprising thing.</li>
<li>Rule of Silence: When a program has nothing surprising to say, it should say nothing.</li>
<li>Rule of Repair: When you must fail, fail noisily and as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Rule of Economy: Programmer time is expensive; conserve it in preference to machine time.</li>
<li>Rule of Generation: Avoid hand-hacking; write programs to write programs when you can.</li>
<li>Rule of Optimization: Prototype before polishing. Get it working before you optimize it.</li>
<li>Rule of Diversity: Distrust all claims for “one true way”.</li>
<li>Rule of Extensibility: Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think.</li>
